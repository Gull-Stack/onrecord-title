            <h3>What is title insurance?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Title insurance protects property owners and lenders from financial loss due to defects in a property's title. Unlike other types of insurance that protect against future events, title insurance protects against claims and problems that already exist but weren't discovered during the title search.</p>

            <h3>Why do I need title insurance?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Title insurance protects you from potentially expensive legal issues that could arise from problems with the property's ownership history, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Forged documents in the chain of title</li>
                <li>Undisclosed heirs claiming ownership</li>
                <li>Liens from unpaid taxes, contractors, or homeowner associations</li>
                <li>Survey errors or boundary disputes</li>
                <li>Fraud or identity theft in previous transactions</li>

            <h3>How much does title insurance cost in Utah?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In Utah, title insurance rates are regulated by the state. The cost is based on the purchase price or loan amount and is a one-time premium paid at closing. For example, on a $400,000 home, the owner's policy would cost approximately $1,200. This one-time payment provides protection for as long as you own the property.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the difference between owner's and lender's title insurance?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Owner's title insurance protects the property owner's equity in the home, while lender's title insurance (required by most lenders) protects only the lender's interest up to the loan amount. As you pay down your mortgage, the lender's coverage decreases, but the owner's policy continues to protect your full ownership interest.</p>

          <h2>Escrow Process</h2>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does escrow mean in Utah real estate?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Escrow is a neutral third-party service that holds funds, documents, and instructions from both buyer and seller during a real estate transaction. The escrow company ensures that all conditions of the purchase agreement are met before the transaction is completed, protecting both parties from fraud or non-compliance.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does the escrow process take?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In Utah, the typical escrow period is 15-30 days, depending on the terms in your purchase agreement. This time allows for inspections, loan approval, title search completion, and resolution of any issues that arise. We work diligently to meet your closing timeline and communicate any potential delays immediately.</p>

          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if issues are found during the title search?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>If we discover title issues (such as liens, judgments, or ownership disputes), we immediately notify all parties and begin working to resolve them. Many issues can be cleared before closing through payoffs, satisfactions, or legal documentation. Our experience helps us resolve problems quickly to keep your transaction on track.</p>

          <h2>Closing</h2>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I bring to closing?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>You should bring:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Government-issued photo identification (driver's license or passport)</li>
                <li>Cashier's check or verified funds for closing costs (if not wiring funds)</li>
                <li>Proof of homeowner's insurance</li>
                <li>Any documents your lender or agent has specifically requested</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We'll provide you with a detailed closing checklist specific to your transaction beforehand.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does a closing appointment take?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Most residential closings take 30-60 minutes, depending on the complexity of the transaction and whether both buyer and seller are present. Commercial closings may take longer due to additional documentation. We review all documents beforehand to make the signing process as efficient as possible.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>When will I get the keys to my new home?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In Utah, keys are typically released after the deed is recorded with the county recorder's office, which happens on the same day as closing. For morning closings, keys are usually available by early afternoon. For afternoon closings, keys may not be available until the next business day, depending on recording office hours.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are typical closing costs in Utah?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Utah closing costs typically range from 2-3% of the home's purchase price and include title insurance, escrow fees, recording fees, and various lender charges.

            <h3>Who pays for title insurance - buyer or seller?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In Utah, payment for title insurance is negotiable and varies by local custom and purchase agreement terms. In some areas, sellers traditionally pay for the owner's policy, while in others, buyers pay. Your real estate agent can advise you on local customs, but ultimately it's whatever is agreed upon in your purchase contract.</p>
