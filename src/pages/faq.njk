    <h2 style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xl);">Title Insurance</h2>
    <div class="faq-list">
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">What is title insurance?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Title insurance is a policy that protects property owners and lenders against financial loss from defects in a title to real property. Unlike other types of insurance that protect against future events, title insurance protects against past events — issues like undisclosed heirs, recording errors, forged documents, or unpaid liens that could affect your ownership rights.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">Do I really need title insurance?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. While your lender will require a lender's policy, an owner's policy protects <em>you</em>. Without it, you could be personally liable for title defects discovered after closing — potentially losing your home or facing expensive legal battles. It's a one-time premium that protects you for as long as you own the property.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">What's the difference between an owner's policy and a lender's policy?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>A <strong>lender's policy</strong> protects only the mortgage lender's interest in the property. An <strong>owner's policy</strong> protects your equity and ownership rights. The lender's policy decreases as you pay down your mortgage and disappears when the loan is paid off. The owner's policy protects you for as long as you or your heirs have an interest in the property.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">How much does title insurance cost in Utah?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Title insurance rates in Utah are regulated by the state. For a $500,000 home, you can expect to pay approximately $1,500-$2,500 for an owner's policy. Use our <a href="/rate-quote/">Rate Quote Calculator</a> for an instant estimate based on your property value.</p></div>

    <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-3xl); margin-bottom: var(--space-xl);">The Closing Process</h2>
    <div class="faq-list">
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">How long does closing take?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>A typical residential closing in Utah takes 30-45 days from the time you go under contract. The actual signing appointment usually takes 45 minutes to an hour. We work to make the process as efficient as possible — many of our closings finish in under 30 minutes at the signing table.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">What documents do I need to bring to closing?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Bring a valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license or passport), your checkbook or proof of wire transfer for closing costs, and any documents your lender or agent has specifically requested. We'll send you a detailed checklist before your closing date so there are no surprises.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">What is escrow and how does it work?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Escrow is a neutral third-party arrangement where funds and documents are held until all conditions of the sale are met. As your escrow agent, OnRecord Title holds the buyer's earnest money, coordinates with lenders, prepares documents, and ensures all parties fulfill their obligations before releasing funds and recording the deed.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary class="faq-question">Can I choose my own title company?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely. In most real estate transactions, the buyer or their agent selects the title company. You are never required to use a specific company, regardless of what anyone tells you. We welcome the opportunity to earn your business — ask your agent about using OnRecord Title.</p></div>
