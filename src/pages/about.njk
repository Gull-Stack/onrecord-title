    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>OnRecord Title was founded with a simple belief: title and escrow services don't have to be complicated, slow, or impersonal. We saw an industry stuck in outdated processes and decided to bring a modern spin to title.</p>
    <p>Based in Midvale, Utah, we serve real estate professionals, lenders, and homeowners across the state. Our team combines deep title expertise with modern technology — online closings, digital document management, and real-time transaction updates — to deliver a closing experience that's fast, transparent, and stress-free.</p>
    <p>Whether you're a first-time buyer, a seasoned investor, or a real estate agent managing dozens of transactions, we treat every deal with the same level of care and attention.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-2xl);">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To make every real estate closing smooth, secure, and on time — with the personal touch that the big corporate title companies have forgotten.</p>
