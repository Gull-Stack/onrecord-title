      <p>When it comes time to close on your home, you have options. Gone are the days when everyone had to squeeze into a conference room at a title company's office. Today, many title companies — including <a href="/">OnRecord Title</a> — offer mobile closing services that bring the entire closing experience to your doorstep.</p>

      <p>But which option is right for you? In this guide, we'll break down the differences between mobile and office closings so you can make an informed choice.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Mobile Closing?</h2>

      <p>A mobile closing is exactly what it sounds like: instead of traveling to the title company's office, a <strong>closing agent comes directly to you</strong>. They bring all the necessary documents, notary equipment, and expertise to conduct the closing wherever you prefer — your home, your office, a coffee shop, or any other convenient location.</p>

      <p>Mobile closings have become increasingly popular in recent years, especially since the pandemic accelerated the demand for flexible, convenient services. At <a href="/services/mobile-closings/">OnRecord Title</a>, mobile closings are one of our most requested services.</p>

      <h2>What Is an Office Closing?</h2>

      <p>An office closing is the traditional approach: you go to the title company's physical office (or sometimes a real estate attorney's office) to sign your closing documents. All parties — buyer, seller, agents — may be present, or closings may be conducted separately.</p>

      <p>Our office is conveniently located at <strong>1275 E Fort Union Boulevard, Suite 210, Midvale, Utah</strong> with easy parking and a comfortable signing room.</p>

      <h2>Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

      <p>Here's how the two options stack up:</p>

      <h2>When to Choose a Mobile Closing</h2>

      <p>A mobile closing might be the perfect fit if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>You have a packed schedule</strong> — Can't take time off work? A mobile closing agent can meet you during lunch, after hours, or on weekends.</li>
        <li><strong>You have young children</strong> — Rather than finding a sitter, close at your kitchen table while the kids play in the next room.</li>
        <li><strong>You have mobility challenges</strong> — No navigating unfamiliar buildings or parking lots.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple signers in different locations</strong> — When buyers or sellers can't easily meet at one office.</li>
        <li><strong>You're purchasing an investment property</strong> — Already at the property doing an inspection or walkthrough? Close right there.</li>
        <li><strong>You just prefer convenience</strong> — And honestly, who doesn't?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Choose an Office Closing</h2>

      <p>An office closing might be better if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>You want a traditional experience</strong> — Some people prefer the formality and structure of a professional office setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost is a primary concern</strong> — Mobile closings may have a small additional fee.</li>
        <li><strong>All parties want to be in one place</strong> — If the buyer, seller, and both agents want to close together, an office provides a neutral, professional environment.</li>
        <li><strong>You're near our office already</strong> — If you live or work near Midvale, stopping by might be just as convenient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What About Remote / Online Closings?</h2>

      <p>There's actually a third option gaining traction: <strong>remote online notarization (RON)</strong>. With RON, you can sign documents and have them notarized via secure video call from anywhere with an internet connection. This is especially useful for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Out-of-state buyers or sellers</li>
        <li>Military personnel stationed elsewhere</li>
        <li>Those who simply prefer a fully digital experience</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Utah allows remote online notarization, and OnRecord Title offers this service. <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to learn more about whether RON is right for your transaction.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>There's no wrong answer here. Both mobile and office closings result in the same legal outcome — a properly executed transfer of property ownership. The difference is purely about <strong>convenience and preference</strong>.</p>

      <p>At OnRecord Title, we're proud to offer both options (plus remote closings) because we believe <strong>your closing should work around your life</strong>, not the other way around. That's what "A Modern Spin on Title" means to us.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"The best closing is the one that causes you the least stress. For most of our clients, that means we come to them."</p>
      </blockquote>
