      <p>Buying a home is likely the largest financial transaction of your life. You'll research neighborhoods, negotiate offers, secure financing, and hire inspectors — all to protect your investment. But there's one critical protection that many buyers overlook or don't fully understand: <strong>title insurance</strong>.</p>

      <p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain exactly what title insurance is, why it matters, what it covers (and doesn't), how much it costs in Utah, and why every homeowner should have it.</p>

      <h2>What Is Title Insurance?</h2>

      <p>Title insurance is a form of <strong>indemnity insurance</strong> that protects property owners and mortgage lenders against financial loss from defects in a property's title. Unlike other types of insurance that protect against future events (like fire or theft), title insurance protects against problems that already exist but haven't been discovered yet.</p>

      <p>When you buy a property, you're not just buying the physical building and land — you're buying the legal right to own and use that property. The "title" is the legal term for that bundle of ownership rights. Title insurance ensures those rights are valid and protectable.</p>

      <h2>How Does Title Insurance Work?</h2>

      <p>The title insurance process has two main components:</p>

      <h3>1. The Title Search</h3>

      <p>Before issuing a policy, the title company (like <a href="/services/">OnRecord Title</a>) conducts a thorough examination of the property's history. This involves searching public records going back decades to trace the chain of ownership and identify any issues. The title examiner looks for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ownership history</strong> — Every transfer of ownership from the original land patent to the current seller</li>
        <li><strong>Liens and encumbrances</strong> — Unpaid mortgages, tax liens, mechanic's liens, judgment liens</li>
        <li><strong>Easements and restrictions</strong> — Utility easements, HOA covenants, zoning restrictions</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary issues</strong> — Survey discrepancies, encroachments, overlapping claims</li>
        <li><strong>Legal proceedings</strong> — Pending lawsuits, probate issues, divorce decrees affecting ownership</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. The Insurance Policy</h3>

      <p>After the title search, the company issues a <strong>title commitment</strong> (also called a preliminary title report) that outlines the findings. If everything checks out, the company issues the actual title insurance policy at closing. This policy protects against any covered defects that were missed during the search.</p>

      <h2>What Does Title Insurance Cover?</h2>

      <p>A standard owner's title insurance policy typically covers financial losses from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forged documents</strong> in the chain of title</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown liens</strong> — unpaid contractor bills, tax liens, or judgments filed against previous owners</li>
        <li><strong>Errors in public records</strong> — recording mistakes, indexing errors, or incorrect legal descriptions</li>
        <li><strong>Undisclosed heirs</strong> who claim ownership rights</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud and impersonation</strong> — someone who sold the property wasn't actually the legal owner</li>
        <li><strong>Missing or defective acknowledgments</strong> on recorded documents</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary and survey disputes</strong> (with enhanced coverage)</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Title insurance is one of the most cost-effective protections available to homeowners. For a one-time premium paid at closing, you're covered for as long as you own the property."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Owner's Policy vs. Lender's Policy</h2>

      <p>There are two types of title insurance policies, and understanding the difference is important:</p>

      <h3>Lender's Policy (Required)</h3>

      <p>If you're getting a mortgage, your lender will require a <strong>lender's title insurance policy</strong>. This protects the lender's financial interest in the property — their loan amount — against title defects. However, this policy does <em>not</em> protect you, the buyer. It only covers the lender.</p>

      <h3>Owner's Policy (Strongly Recommended)</h3>

      <p>An <strong>owner's title insurance policy</strong> protects your equity in the property. It covers you from the date of purchase for as long as you (or your heirs) own the property. This is optional but highly recommended — without it, you're personally responsible for any title defects that arise.</p>

      <p>Consider this scenario: You buy a home for $400,000. Two years later, a contractor who worked on the property before you bought it files a mechanic's lien for $25,000 in unpaid work. Without an owner's policy, you're responsible for paying that $25,000. With an owner's policy, the title insurance company handles it.</p>

      <h2>How Much Does Title Insurance Cost in Utah?</h2>

      <p>Title insurance in Utah is a <strong>one-time premium</strong> paid at closing — there are no monthly or annual payments. Rates are based on the property's purchase price and are regulated by the Utah Insurance Department.</p>

      <p>For a typical Utah home purchase:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>$300,000 home:</strong> Approximately $1,200–$1,800 for combined policies</li>
        <li><strong>$400,000 home:</strong> Approximately $1,500–$2,500 for combined policies</li>
        <li><strong>$500,000 home:</strong> Approximately $1,800–$3,000 for combined policies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For an exact quote based on your specific transaction, use our <a href="/rate-quote/">Rate Quote Calculator</a> — it takes less than 30 seconds.</p>

      <h2>Who Pays for Title Insurance?</h2>

      <p>In Utah, it's customary (but negotiable) for the <strong>seller to pay for the owner's title insurance policy</strong> and the <strong>buyer to pay for the lender's policy</strong>. However, this is always part of the purchase negotiation. Your real estate agent can help negotiate these costs.</p>

      <h2>Common Title Issues We Find</h2>

      <p>You might think title problems are rare, but our team at OnRecord Title regularly discovers issues during the title search process. Some of the most common include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Outstanding mortgages</strong> that weren't properly released after payoff</li>
        <li><strong>HOA liens</strong> for unpaid assessments</li>
        <li><strong>Property tax liens</strong> from previous owners</li>
        <li><strong>Judgment liens</strong> from lawsuits against previous owners</li>
        <li><strong>Errors in legal descriptions</strong> that need correction</li>
        <li><strong>Missing signatures</strong> on previous deeds or releases</li>
        <li><strong>Easements</strong> that restrict property use</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The good news? When we find these issues during the title search, we work to resolve them <em>before</em> closing so they don't become your problem. That's part of the value of working with an experienced title company.</p>

      <h2>What Title Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>

      <p>Title insurance has some standard exceptions and exclusions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Defects or liens you created or agreed to</li>
        <li>Issues that would be revealed by a current survey (unless you get survey coverage)</li>
        <li>Government regulations (zoning, building codes) in standard policies</li>
        <li>Environmental contamination</li>
        <li>Native American claims on very old properties</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many of these exceptions can be eliminated with <strong>enhanced coverage policies</strong> or specific endorsements. Talk to your title officer about what additional protections make sense for your situation.</p>

      <h2>Is Title Insurance Worth It?</h2>

      <p>Absolutely. Consider the math:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A title insurance policy costs roughly <strong>0.5% of the purchase price</strong> — one time</li>
        <li>It protects an asset worth <strong>hundreds of thousands of dollars</strong></li>
        <li>Coverage lasts <strong>for as long as you own the property</strong></li>
        <li>The alternative is being personally liable for <strong>any title defects</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>No other form of insurance offers this kind of value — lifetime protection for a single premium.</p>

      <h2>How to Choose a Title Company</h2>

      <p>In Utah, you have the right to choose your title company. Here's what to look for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Licensed and insured</strong> — Verify they're licensed with the Utah Insurance Department</li>
        <li><strong>Experienced staff</strong> — Look for dedicated title examiners and escrow officers</li>
        <li><strong>Communication</strong> — They should keep you informed throughout the process</li>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong> — Modern title companies offer online tracking and digital options</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — Mobile closings, online closings, and convenient scheduling</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent pricing</strong> — No hidden fees or surprises at closing</li>
      </ul>
