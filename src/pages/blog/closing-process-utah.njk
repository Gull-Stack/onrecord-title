      <p>You've found the perfect home, negotiated the deal, and your financing is in place. Now comes the final — and often most confusing — step: <strong>closing</strong>. The closing process in Utah involves multiple parties, numerous documents, and several critical deadlines. This guide walks you through every step so you know exactly what to expect.</p>

      <h2>What Is "Closing" on a Home?</h2>

      <p>Closing (also called "settlement") is the final step in a real estate transaction. It's when ownership of the property officially transfers from the seller to the buyer. During closing, you'll sign legal documents, pay closing costs, and receive the keys to your new home.</p>

      <p>In Utah, closings are typically handled by a <strong>title company</strong> (like <a href="/">OnRecord Title</a>) that serves as a neutral third party. The title company manages escrow, prepares documents, conducts the title search, and coordinates between all parties — buyers, sellers, agents, and lenders.</p>

      <h2>The Utah Closing Timeline</h2>

      <p>A typical Utah home purchase takes <strong>25-45 days</strong> from accepted offer to closing. Here's the general timeline:</p>

      <div style="margin: var(--space-xl) 0;">
        <div class="timeline">
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Days 1-3: Title Order Opened</h3>
            <p>Your agent or lender sends the purchase contract to the title company. We open the file, order the title search, and begin examining the property's ownership history.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Days 3-10: Title Search & Examination</h3>
            <p>Our title examiners search public records to verify ownership, identify liens, check for easements, and ensure the seller can legally transfer the property. We issue a title commitment outlining our findings.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Days 5-15: Due Diligence Period</h3>
            <p>This is your window to conduct inspections, appraisals, and review the title commitment. If the title search reveals issues, the title company works to resolve them during this period.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Days 15-25: Loan Processing</h3>
            <p>Your lender finalizes underwriting, orders the appraisal, and prepares loan documents. The title company coordinates with the lender on title requirements and insurance.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Days 20-28: Closing Disclosure</h3>
            <p>Federal law requires you to receive the Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing. This document details every cost, credit, and payment in the transaction. Review it carefully.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Day 25-30: Closing Day 🎉</h3>
            <p>You sign the documents, funds are transferred, the deed is recorded, and you get the keys. The typical closing appointment takes 45-90 minutes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>What Happens at the Closing Table</h2>

      <p>The actual closing appointment is where the magic happens. Here's what to expect:</p>

      <h3>Before You Arrive</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Review your Closing Disclosure carefully — compare it to your Loan Estimate</li>
        <li>Arrange your down payment and closing costs (wire transfer or cashier's check)</li>
        <li>Complete a final walkthrough of the property</li>
        <li>Confirm your homeowner's insurance is in place</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>At the Closing</h3>

      <p>The closing agent (from the title company) will guide you through each document. Key documents include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Closing Disclosure</strong> — Final accounting of all costs and credits</li>
        <li><strong>Promissory Note</strong> — Your promise to repay the mortgage</li>
        <li><strong>Deed of Trust</strong> — Gives the lender a security interest in the property</li>
        <li><strong>Warranty Deed</strong> — Transfers ownership from seller to buyer</li>
        <li><strong>Title Insurance Policies</strong> — Owner's and lender's coverage</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer Tax Declarations</strong> — Required by the state/county</li>
        <li><strong>Affidavits</strong> — Various sworn statements about the property and transaction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don't rush through signing. Ask questions about anything you don't understand — that's what the closing agent is there for.</p>

      <h2>Closing Day Checklist</h2>

      <p>Here's what to bring to your closing:</p>

      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Valid government-issued photo ID</strong> (driver's license or passport) — for each person signing</li>
        <li><strong>Cashier's check or wire transfer confirmation</strong> — for your down payment and closing costs (the title company will provide the exact amount)</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of homeowner's insurance</strong> — your insurance declarations page showing coverage effective on closing day</li>
        <li><strong>Your checkbook</strong> — in case there are minor adjustments to the closing figures</li>
        <li><strong>Any outstanding documents</strong> your lender or title company has requested</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="card" style="background: var(--light-bg); margin: var(--space-xl) 0; padding: var(--space-xl);">
        <h3>⚠️ Wire Fraud Warning</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Wire fraud targeting real estate transactions is a serious and growing threat. <strong>Always verify wiring instructions by calling the title company directly</strong> using a phone number you already have — never use contact information from an email. OnRecord Title will never change wiring instructions via email.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding Your Closing Costs</h2>

      <p>Closing costs in Utah typically range from <strong>2-5% of the purchase price</strong> for buyers. Here's a breakdown of common costs:</p>

      <h3>Buyer's Typical Costs:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lender's title insurance</strong> — Protects your mortgage company</li>
        <li><strong>Loan origination fees</strong> — Charged by your lender</li>
        <li><strong>Appraisal fee</strong> — Usually $400-600</li>
        <li><strong>Home inspection</strong> — Usually $300-500 (paid before closing)</li>
        <li><strong>Recording fees</strong> — County charges to record the deed and mortgage</li>
        <li><strong>Prepaid items</strong> — Property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and mortgage interest prorated to closing</li>
        <li><strong>Escrow reserves</strong> — Initial deposits for your tax and insurance escrow account</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Seller's Typical Costs:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Owner's title insurance policy</strong> — Customarily paid by the seller in Utah</li>
        <li><strong>Real estate agent commissions</strong> — Typically 5-6% of the sale price</li>
        <li><strong>Recording fees</strong> — For the deed and any lien releases</li>
        <li><strong>Prorated taxes</strong> — Your share of property taxes through closing</li>
        <li><strong>HOA fees</strong> — Prorated if applicable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After Closing</h2>

      <p>The work doesn't stop when you sign the last document:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recording:</strong> The title company records the deed and mortgage with the county recorder's office — typically within 24 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Disbursement:</strong> Funds are distributed to the seller, agents, lender, and other parties</li>
        <li><strong>Title policy:</strong> Your owner's title insurance policy is issued and mailed to you (usually within 2-4 weeks)</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your documents:</strong> Store your closing documents safely — you'll need them for taxes and any future sale or refinance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for a Smooth Closing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Respond quickly</strong> to requests from your lender and title company</li>
        <li><strong>Don't make major financial changes</strong> between contract and closing (new credit cards, large purchases, job changes)</li>
        <li><strong>Keep funds traceable</strong> — lenders need to verify the source of your down payment</li>
        <li><strong>Do a final walkthrough</strong> the day of or before closing</li>
        <li><strong>Ask questions early</strong> — don't wait until closing day to raise concerns</li>
        <li><strong>Consider a <a href="/services/mobile-closings/">mobile closing</a></strong> for added convenience</li>
      </ul>
